## ‚öîÔ∏è Decision Mechanics

### **Player Actions**
Each round, you must choose one of two actions:

#### **ü§ù Cooperate**
- **Description**: Work together with other players
- **Strategy**: Build trust and mutual benefit
- **Risk**: Vulnerable to betrayal

#### **‚öîÔ∏è Defect** 
- **Description**: Betray other players for personal gain
- **Strategy**: Exploit cooperative opponents
- **Risk**: Penalties when everyone defects

### **AI Decision Logic**

#### **Trusty AI (70% base cooperation)**
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Cooperation rate increases based on player's cooperation history
- **Formula**: `0.7 + (player_cooperation_rate * 0.2)`
- **Personality**: Trust-building, relationship-focused
- **Thought Process**: "Trust builds stronger bonds!"

#### **Risky AI (40% base cooperation)**
- **Progressive Risk**: Gets riskier as game progresses
- **Formula**: `0.4 - (current_round / 20)`
- **Personality**: Calculated risk-taker, opportunistic
- **Thought Process**: "Fortune favors the bold!"

## üèÜ Scoring System

### **Cooperation Matrix**

The scoring system is based on the number of players who cooperate in each round:

| Cooperators | Defectors | Result | Points Formula |
|-------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 3 | 0 | **Perfect Cooperation** | Base Points √ó 1.5 (+50%) |
| 2 | 1 | **Mixed Strategy** | Cooperators: Base Points<br>Defectors: Base Points √ó 1.25 (+25%) |
| 1 | 2 | **Mixed Strategy** | Cooperators: Base Points<br>Defectors: Base Points √ó 1.25 (+25%) |
| 0 | 3 | **Total Defection** | Base Points √ó 0.75 (-25%) |

### **Score Calculation Example**

**Scenario**: All players have 100-point Pok√©mon

**Round 1**: All Cooperate
- Everyone gets: 100 √ó 1.5 = **150 points**

**Round 2**: 2 Cooperate, 1 Defects  
- Cooperators get: 100 points each
- Defector gets: 100 √ó 1.25 = **125 points**

**Round 3**: All Defect
- Everyone gets: 100 √ó 0.75 = **75 points**

### **Cumulative Scoring**
- Scores accumulate across all 8 rounds
- No negative scores (minimum 0)
- Final ranking determines winner

## üéÆ Strategic Considerations

### **Short-term vs. Long-term Strategy**

#### **Immediate Benefits**
- **Defection**: +25% bonus in mixed scenarios
- **Cooperation**: Base points, but enables team bonuses

#### **Long-term Consequences**
- **Defection**: May trigger retaliation from AI
- **Cooperation**: Builds trust for future rounds

### **AI Adaptation Patterns**

#### **Trusty AI Learning**
- **Cooperation History**: Tracks your cooperation rate
- **Adaptation**: Becomes more cooperative if you cooperate
- **Strategy**: Builds mutual trust over time

#### **Risky AI Progression**
- **Risk Escalation**: Gets riskier each round
- **Timing**: Early rounds safer, later rounds more aggressive
- **Strategy**: Exploits predictable patterns

### **Optimal Strategies by Game Phase**

#### **Early Game (Rounds 1-3)**
- **Recommended**: Establish cooperation patterns
- **Reasoning**: Build trust with Trusty AI
- **Risk**: Risky AI is still relatively safe

#### **Mid Game (Rounds 4-6)**
- **Recommended**: Adapt based on opponent behavior
- **Reasoning**: AI patterns become clearer
- **Strategy**: Exploit predictable opponents

#### **Late Game (Rounds 7-8)**
- **Recommended**: Aggressive defection if leading
- **Reasoning**: Risky AI becomes very aggressive
- **Strategy**: Secure victory or catch up

## üéØ Advanced Tactics

### **Pattern Recognition**
- **Trusty AI**: Look for cooperation trends
- **Risky AI**: Notice increasing aggression
- **Your History**: Consider how your past actions affect AI behavior

### **Risk Assessment**
- **High-Risk Scenarios**: When both AI might defect
- **Safe Scenarios**: When Trusty AI is likely to cooperate
- **Mixed Scenarios**: Calculate expected value of each choice

### **Psychological Warfare**
- **Trust Building**: Consistent cooperation with Trusty AI
- **Bluffing**: Occasional defection to keep opponents guessing
- **Retaliation**: Defect if consistently betrayed

## üèÖ Victory Conditions

### **Final Ranking**
1. **Winner**: Highest total score after 8 rounds
2. **Runner-up**: Second highest score
3. **Third Place**: Lowest score

### **Tie-Breaking**
- **Cooperation Rate**: Higher cooperation rate wins ties
- **Final Round Performance**: Better final round performance wins
- **Random**: Coin flip for identical performances
