  - **Name** and **Emoji representation**
  - **Type(s)** (Fire, Water, Electric, etc.)
  - **Base Points** (10-106 points)
  - **Visual styling** with type-appropriate colors

#### 2. **Strategic Decisions**
Every round, you must choose one of two actions:

- **🤝 Cooperate**: Work together with other players
- **⚔️ Defect**: Betray other players for personal gain

#### 3. **AI Opponents**

- **Result**: +50% bonus points for everyone!
- **Strategy**: Maximum mutual benefit

#### **All Players Defect (0 cooperators)**
- **Result**: -25% penalty for everyone
- **Strategy**: Everyone loses due to lack of trust
